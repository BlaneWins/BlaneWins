> Workstations of the "Macro Data Refinement" (MDR) team on the AppleTV show *Severance*, currently the greatest show on television (my opinion), *circa 2025*. The office is fictitious, set inside the "Lumon" testing floor which is filmed in the real life location, inside of the "Bell Works" building, where the programming language C was largely developed in 1972.
